# Idle Timer Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Wrong
The idle timer wasn't counting down because the `useEffect` had `context.idleCountdown` and `state` as dependencies, which caused the interval to restart every time the countdown changed, preventing it from actually counting down.

## What I Fixed
1. **Removed problematic dependencies** from the idle timer useEffect
2. **Added debug logging** to the state machine to track IDLE_TICK events
3. **Fixed syntax error** in ScreenIdle.tsx (`theimport` → `import`)

## How to Test Now
1. **Open** http://localhost:3000
2. **Look at the status bar** - you should see "Idle: 40s" 
3. **Wait 40 seconds** without interacting - the countdown should decrease
4. **Check browser console** for debug logs:
   - `IDLE_TICK: countdown=X, state=Y` every second
5. **At 0 seconds** should show "Still there? Starting over in 5..." screen

## Debug Tools Available
- **Status bar**: Shows idle countdown with color coding (blue/yellow/red)
- **Debug panel**: Press 'D' to toggle, shows detailed info
- **Test buttons**: "Test Idle" and "Force Idle" for instant testing
- **Console logs**: Check browser dev tools for debug messages
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press 'T' to trigger idle warning

## Expected Behavior
- **Idle countdown** should decrease from 40 to 0 over 40 seconds
- **User interaction** (click, keypress, touch) should reset to 40
- **Scale readings** should NOT reset the timer
- **At 0 seconds** should show idle warning screen
- **After 5 seconds** should return to Welcome screen

The idle timer should now work properly! If you still don't see it counting down, check the browser console for the debug logs to see what's happening.
